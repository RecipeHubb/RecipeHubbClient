              It is a personal platform where you can add recipes, and include necessary information about them, including

          <div><h1 class="text-xl">Another cool feature is that this platform is also public! Users have the
              ability to view all recipes by other users of the platform that they mark as a publically accessible recipe. You 
              are then able to view these recipes and comment on them and drop a rating for the original owner. It is platform
              that boasts the easyness of storing your own recipes for quick retrieval, as well as looking for new ideas to spice
              up your recipe game!</h1></div>
